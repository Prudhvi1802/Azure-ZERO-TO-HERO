Self introduction  For British Airways:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hello everyone, my name is Prudhvi Gudipati. I’ve been working as a DevOps Engineer at Tata Consultancy Services for the past three years. 
For one of the major reputative banking  client, UBS, where I manage cloud infrastructure on both Azure using Terraform.  Used modules for code reusability and time saving,
I also build and maintain CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins and Azure DevOps, helping the teams to deploy and manage   applications faster and more reliably.
During this time  i was worked with Docker and Kubernetes for container orchrastration pupose in order to seamsely deploy the applications. 
and I’ve integrated security and quality tools like SonarQube, Trivy, and OWASP ZAP into our pipelines.

For reputative tasks or day to day manual tasks , i wrote shell  scripts which automate the work and saves a lot of time  and saves from the  errors. 
I’ve also set up monitoring using Prometheus and Grafana to keep systems running smoothly.

During this tenure my one of the key accomplishment is introduction of  Kubernetes setup using Spot VMs and auto-scaling, which helped reduce our cloud costs by 20%. I even got a Star of the Month award for that.

Overall, I’m passionate about DevOps because it lets me automate, improve systems, and help teams deliver better software faster.

PROJECT:
I'm currently working as a DevOps Engineer on a project for UBS, one of the top banking clients, through Tata Consultancy Services. The main goal of this project is to help the client move their applications to the cloud, automate deployments, improve system reliability, and reduce cloud costs.

We use both Azure and AWS for cloud services, and I manage the infrastructure using Terraform. I’ve built reusable Terraform modules so we can set up environments like Dev, QA, and Prod faster and more consistently.

On the CI/CD side, I’ve created pipelines using Jenkins and Azure DevOps that automate everything from code building to deployment. This helped the team push new updates much faster and with fewer errors.

For running applications, we use Docker and deploy everything into Kubernetes clusters. I also helped optimize these clusters using Spot VMs and auto-scaling, which saved about 20% in cloud costs. I got a Star of the Month award for that work.

Security is a big part of our job too. So, I integrated tools like SonarQube to check code quality, Trivy to scan Docker images for vulnerabilities, and OWASP ZAP to test for common security issues in our apps.

To reduce manual work, I write scripts in Bash and Python to automate daily tasks. I also set up Prometheus and Grafana to monitor the system and send alerts if something goes wrong.

I work closely with developers and testers in an Agile team, attend daily stand-ups, and help with incident handling when needed. Overall, the project has given me great experience in cloud, automation, security, and collaboration.
