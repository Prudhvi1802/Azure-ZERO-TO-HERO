Self introduction  For British Airways:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hello everyone, my name is Prudhvi Gudipati. I’ve been working as a DevOps Engineer at Tata Consultancy Services for the past three years. 
For one of the major reputative banking  client, UBS, where I manage cloud infrastructure on both Azure using Terraform.  Used modules for code reusability and time saving,
I also build and maintain CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins and Azure DevOps, helping the teams to deploy and manage   applications faster and more reliably.
During this time  i was worked with Docker and Kubernetes for container orchrastration pupose in order to seamsely deploy the applications. 
and I’ve integrated security and quality tools like SonarQube, Trivy, and OWASP ZAP into our pipelines.

For reputative tasks or day to day manual tasks , i wrote shell  scripts which automate the work and saves a lot of time  and saves from the  errors. 
I’ve also set up monitoring using Prometheus and Grafana to keep systems running smoothly.

During this tenure my one of the key accomplishment is introduction of  Kubernetes setup using Spot VMs and auto-scaling, which helped reduce our cloud costs by 20%. I even got a Star of the Month award for that.

Overall, I’m passionate about DevOps because it lets me automate, improve systems, and help teams deliver better software faster.
